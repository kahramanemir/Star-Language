# Star Language

## 📌 About The Project
Star Language is a custom programming language designed to handle simple arithmetic and text operations efficiently. It provides a structured syntax that allows for variable declarations, operations, loops, and input/output functions. 

## 🚀 Features
✅ Variable Declarations (Integer & String)
✅ Arithmetic Operations (+, -, *, /)
✅ String Manipulation (Concatenation, Substring Removal)
✅ Looping Mechanism (Nested loops supported with limitations)
✅ User Input & Console Output
✅ Lexical Analysis & Interpretation

## ⚡ Getting Started
To get started with Star Language, follow these steps:

## 📜 Syntax & Usage
### 🔹 Variable Declaration
```star
int x is 10.
text message is "Hello, World!".
```

### 🔹 Arithmetic & String Operations
```star
int result is 5 + 3.
text fullName is "John" + "Doe".
```

### 🔹 Loops
```star
for 3 times {
    write "*".
}
```

### 🔹 Input & Output
```star
read "Enter your name: ", name.
write "Hello, ", name.
```

## ⚠️ Limitations
🚫 Nested loops only work if the inner loop is a one-liner.
🚫 Negative integers default to 0.
🚫 String length has a predefined limit.
